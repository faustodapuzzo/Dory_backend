# Dory_backend
Backend development of automated Raman Spectroscopy System (Dory).  
Includes low-level hardware communication up to high-level functionalities 
(auto-focus, sample-finding, caddy-scanning, spectrum-acquisition...) that can be called directly by the fron-end.

This development was part of a System Integration project performed at Hewlett-Packard Inc. Laboratories.
The present python code was developed by Fausto D'Apuzzo between Feb-Mar 2017,
under supervision of Alex P.
